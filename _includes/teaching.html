                    <p style= "text-align: left">I love to engage in knowledge exchange and therefore already started teaching as an undergraduate as a tutor for German Philology at the University of Münster. From there on I luckily progressed throughout my academic life, being offered the opportunity to teach the great variety of different subjects - for the full list of courses I taught and the workshops I offer, please refer to <a href="CV.pdf">my CV</a>.</p>
                    <p style= "text-align: left">Moreover, I am always happy to take advanced trainings in higher education and didactics. I for instance obtained the <a href="Zertifikat_Hochschullehre.compressed.pdf">certificate ‘Hochschuldidaktik’</a> issued by the Federal District of North-Rhine Westphalia by completing a series of workshops on different teaching skills (such as degree program accreditation or developing online learning units) that had an overall workload of more than 160 hours.</p>
                    <p style= "text-align: left">If you are interested, I am always happy to share materials on my courses.</p>

It provides a basic understanding of what AI actually is, what its limitations are, and why artificial intelligence should never be thought of entirely independent from human intelligence.</p>
